my thinkings over application originpro and imaginative ideas on how to print aesthetical figures
During the experiments, the recordings were performed in a quiet speech lab with Audio-technica ATR2500-USB microphone and Audio-technica ATH-M20x monitor headset, and the recordings have undergone waveform processes by Adobe Audition based on the computer's built-in sound processor (relevent hardware settings:  44100Hz of sampling frequency, mono 16-bit resolutione, and wav format of storage). After recording, our researchers used Praat to slice the speech and perform vowel annotation, and created Textgrid files with the investigated phonemes and performed hierarchical division, as well as alignments and phoneme boundary adjustments. After completing all the processing of the recording files, researchers extracted formant values (F1 and F2) for the target vowels /e/ and /æ/ using the praat script from @Zenmule, and finally the data in the output files were averaged and prepared for the coming stages of analysis.
